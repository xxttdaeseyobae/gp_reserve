        </div>
        <p class="lead">Airline Reservation System is an organization that provides theatre programming to incarcerated and court-involved young people. We are a mobile drama club, bringing our classes into juvenile detention centers, jails and community centers throughout the city. It started as a rehearsal process of a play at Crossroads Juvenile Center, which was presented as a staged reading for staff, fellow residents and family members. The success of this project blossomed into a consistent year-round program.Currently, Drama Club works with approximately 500 individual students between the ages of 10-21, developing theatre is offered at five different sites, across three boroughs.We use improvisational theatre as our core curriculum, because improv is play which involves healthy risk-taking and empowers young people to tell the stories they want to tell, in the ways in which they want to tell them. Students learn to cultivate focus and practice impulse control in a safe environment. Kids with various literacy rates and even different languages can participate in improv, exploring boundaries in a world they have created. In stark contrast to their school environments where they were often disciplined, our classes become positive, transformative spaces where they can learn and grow. Drama Club kids say "Yes, and..." and keep coming back to our classes over and over again. Some have even become peer mentors for other youth after they are released. </p>
